# DrawBench at a Glance

This repo compares images generated by awesome generative models on the [DrawBench](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1y7nAbmR4FREi6npB1u-Bo3GFdwdOPYJc617rBOxIRHY/edit#gid=0) provided in Imagen. Currently, it includes images generated with some OpenSource image generative models (stable diffusion 1-4, 1-5, 2-1). One can browse the generated images and get a rough idea about the capability of these models. 

### Features
1. The repo includes results generated by 3 stable diffusion models (1-4, 1-5, 2-1) with 200 prompts from DrawBench, organized by prompt categories. 
2. The provided scripts can be used to generate images with additional prompts and private models and provide organized results (the README files in each sub-directory display the results). 

### Limitations
1. Currently, this repo only includes 3 OpenSource stable diffusion models.
2. Currently, this repo only includes images generated with one random seed (`0`), which makes the comparison not comprehensive.

### Generate the images on your own
1. Create a conda environment: `conda env create -f bench.yaml`.
2. Activate the conda environment: `conda activate bench`.
3. Run the notebook `GenImages.ipynb`. It takes ~30 minutes to generate a single image for 200 prompts with 3 different diffusion models on a single RTX3090.
